# TEM2DDSCAT

This repository contains a Python code designed to convert Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images into DDSCAT-compatible geometries. Additionally, the code calculates basic statistics, such as particle size distribution, to facilitate quantitative analysis of particle geometries.

## Features

- **TEM to DDSCAT Conversion**: Automatically generate DDSCAT-compatible geometry files from TEM images.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Compute particle size distribution and other basic statistics.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple input-output workflow with well-documented functionality.
